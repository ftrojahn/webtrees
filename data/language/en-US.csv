<br> (www.webgenealogie.de),
<br>
<br> we welcome you in the circle of our users. A short overview of how to use this database you can read at http://www.webgenealogie.de/ftp/ba_db_en_on.pdf or
<br>
<br> http://www.graenz.name/sonder-webmeeting-webgenealogie-2010 
<br>
<br> We would be delighted to include in the database your registers of regestas and lists of ancestors compiled in your family research, if those are complemented by detailed information about, and copies of, the original source documents (church records, tax records, court records, etc.). If you are interested please contact team[at]webgenealogie[dot]de.
<br>
<br> If you would like to contribute to the joint project e.g. by transcribing texts, copying lists of ancesters and record cards, controlling tasks etc. please contact the e-mail address mentioned above. There you can also obtain answers to your questions about using the database.
<br>
<br> We do not process genealogical questions and requests on this site. 
<br> Please contact the addresses or phone numbers of the respective researchers.

<br> We look forward to co-operating with you.
<br>
<br> Best regards from Dresden,
